    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      
      const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
      
      const cap = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12});
      
      console.log(cap);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
